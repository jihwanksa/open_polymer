# Contributing to Open Polymer

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Open Polymer! This document provides guidelines for contributing to the project.

## Getting Started

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** locally:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/open_polymer.git
   cd open_polymer
   ```
3. **Set up the development environment**:
   ```bash
   conda create -n polymer_pred python=3.10 -y
   conda activate polymer_pred
   conda install -c conda-forge rdkit -y
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

- Use the GitHub issue tracker
- Include a clear description of the problem
- Provide steps to reproduce the issue
- Include error messages and logs
- Specify your environment (OS, Python version, etc.)

### Suggesting Enhancements

- Use the GitHub issue tracker with the "enhancement" label
- Clearly describe the proposed feature
- Explain why it would be useful
- Provide examples if possible

### Code Contributions

1. **Create a new branch** for your feature:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes** following our coding standards:
   - Follow PEP 8 style guide
   - Add docstrings to functions and classes
   - Include type hints where appropriate
   - Write clear commit messages

3. **Test your changes**:
   ```bash
   python src/data_preprocessing.py  # Test preprocessing
   python src/train.py              # Test full pipeline
   ```

4. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add: Clear description of your changes"
   ```

5. **Push to your fork**:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

6. **Submit a Pull Request** on GitHub

## Coding Standards

### Python Style
- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use meaningful variable names
- Keep functions focused and small
- Add comments for complex logic

### Documentation
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add docstrings for new functions/classes
- Update type hints
- Include usage examples

### Commit Messages
- Use present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- Start with a verb (Add, Fix, Update, Remove)
- Be specific and descriptive
- Reference issues when applicable (#123)

## Areas for Contribution

We welcome contributions in the following areas:

### High Priority

## Testing

Before submitting a pull request:

1. **Test data processing**:
   ```python
   from src.data_preprocessing import MolecularDataProcessor
   processor = MolecularDataProcessor()
   # Test with sample SMILES
   ```

2. **Test model training**:
   ```bash
   python src/train.py
   ```

3. **Verify imports**:
   ```python
   from src.models import TraditionalMLModel, GNNModel, TransformerModel
   ```
