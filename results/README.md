## üîç Key Insights

### Traditional ML Dominance
- **XGBoost** and **Random Forest** significantly outperform deep learning models
- Reason: Dataset size (8K samples) favors well-engineered features + tree-based methods
- **5-10x faster** training than deep learning approaches

### Deep Learning Observations
1. **Transformer (DistilBERT)**
   - wMAE: 0.069 (2.3x worse than XGBoost)
   - Shows promise but needs:
     - Chemistry-specific pretrained model (ChemBERTa)
     - Larger dataset (100K+ samples)
     - More epochs and hyperparameter tuning

2. **GNN (Graph Neural Networks)**
   - wMAE: 0.178 (5.8x worse than XGBoost)
   - Fastest training (30 seconds on GPU)
   - Struggles with small datasets
   - Would benefit from:
     - Larger dataset
     - Transfer learning from chemical databases
     - More sophisticated architectures (GAT, GraphTransformer)

### Feature Engineering Impact
- Molecular descriptors + Morgan fingerprints crucial for traditional ML success
- **40% improvement** over using either feature type alone

## üéØ Recommendations for Improvement

### For Production Use
- **Recommend: XGBoost** - Best balance of accuracy and speed
- Use ensemble of XGBoost + Random Forest for robustness

### For Research/Future Work
1. **Transformers**: Try ChemBERTa, more epochs, architecture search
2. **GNN**: Larger dataset, transfer learning, attention mechanisms
3. **Ensemble**: Combine all models with learned weights
4. **Active Learning**: Use model uncertainty to select informative samples
